A basic docker-compose recipe to spin up the containers necessary for running a headless wordpress backend and nuxt / vue frontend.

Recommended wp plugins 
- Advanced Custom Fields
- Better-Search-Replace
- Redis-Cache
- Safe-SVG
- WP-GraphQL
- WP-User-Avatar

Recommended Themes
- Nude (for Headless WP)

The recipe should spin up a working site with SSL. It's not very user friendly at the moment but I will improve it over time to make it more generic.
